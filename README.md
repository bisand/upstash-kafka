# Upstash.Kafka.Client

An HTTP/REST based Kafka client built on top of
[Upstash REST API](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka/rest).

C# implementation of a client library using Upstash HTTP/REST api, suited for situations where HTTP is the only option.

> **Disclaimer**!  
This library is **not** associated with Upstash in any way, but it is inspired by the [javascript implementation from Upstash](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-kafka). Some of the text in this readme is borrowed from there.

## The implementation

[Upstash.Kafka.Client](src/UpstashKafka/) can be found here.
